# Calculator

Calculator is the final project for the foundations section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It is intended to give students a project that combines the fundamentals of the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS stack. Working demo [here](https://implexrr.github.io/calculator/).
